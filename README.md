# VBA Scripts

This repository contains sample VBA scripts, including:
- **FilterBySelected.bas:** A script that filters data based on the selected cell.
- **FilterBySelectedExclude.bas:** A script that filters data by excluding specific values.

## How to Use

1. Copy the desired module file (`.bas`) into your VBA project.
2. In the VBA editor, right-click your project → Import File, and select the corresponding `.bas` file.
3. Adjust the code to suit your needs.

**Tip:** For added convenience, you can copy or add these macros to your PERSONAL.xlsb workbook. By doing so, and assigning a keyboard shortcut (via Tools → Macro → Options), the macros become available in all Excel workbooks, ensuring you have quick and constant access to them.
